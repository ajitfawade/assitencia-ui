 `Note:`<br/>
 `1. This boilerplate/template is meant for basic stack only, without any complexities like node, docker, any UI libraries other than` <a href='https://ant.design/' target='_blank'>antd</a>` etc`<br/>
 `2. This is open-source template which is combination of simplified UI components(Button, Input, Toggle, etc...).`<br/>
`3. If you are beginier with react, then we recommend not to use this boilerplate, rather creating & configuring it on your own will be a good learning lesson.`<br/>
`4. If you are looking for heavily tested and ready-to-use, component integrated boilerplate then we highly recommend to use `<a href='https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate'>https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate</a>`
